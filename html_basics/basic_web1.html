        <p>Ballroom dancing is a type of dance style that originally came from Europe in the 16th century. It is performed by a couple that follows a routine of given steps.There are many types of ballroom. Such as latin dances like samba, cha cha, rumba. There is also jive and triple swing which are more upbeat. Then the classics like waltz and foxtrot and quickstep.  Competitively dancing ballroom is what I do, however, one could do it just for fun. Keeping in mind that ballroom competitions are fast paced and stressful but so worth it. There is specific ballroom ettiquette such as looking your partener in the eye, making what is called a "ballroom face", and apologizing to people when you certainly will crash into them.</p>
