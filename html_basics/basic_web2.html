        <p>So far, I really like this class. I loved the programming unit and being able to learn a whole new language. I also liked the layout of the class. I always know exactly what I am going to be working on whether by lookin gon the organized canvas page or just knowing because of schedule. This class is definitely one of my favorites because I'm always learning something new. I also like the size of the class, there are not too many people so I can focus. It's also just a fun class. Th eblookets are fun and also good reviews for me. Overall I would give this class a 4.5 out of 5 stars.</p>
