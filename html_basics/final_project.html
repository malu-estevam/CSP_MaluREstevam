        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p id="facts">An interesting fact about the arches is that it used to be underwater. This is why the arches are shaped the way they are. Another facts is that the soil is actually "alive." Living organisms like green algae, mosses, and fungi actually hold the whole park together. And finally, there was at least 11 movies filmed there. Movies like Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Thelma and Louise, and Hulk.</p>
