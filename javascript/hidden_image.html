    <h1>Brazilian Food</h1>
    
    <h2>Random facts and background</h2>
    <p>Brazilian cuisine comes from many different backgrounds due to it's diverse culture. The mix of flavors include African, European, Indigenous, and Portuguese cultures. Brazilians especially love barbecues which mostly just comes from their culture. Asian, Lebanese, and Syrian foods were also introduced. Things like kibes, tempura, and falafel. Another interesting fact is that tapioca is native to Brazil. Coffee is also a central part of culture, market, and life. One could drink coffee at anytime in the day.</p>

    <h2>How did it shape America?</h2>
    <p>Something Brazilians use that most other countries don't care for are Brazilian nuts and cheeses. Nuts became an everyday snack in some American lives due to the availability of them coming from Brazil. Cheese is eaten with the regular barbecues, which were also brought to America from Brazil. Brazilians are also very big on fresh fruits and staying healthy. You could eat the same amount of food in Brazil that you eat in America and might still loose weight. Making American foods healthy is something that is still in process however.</p>
